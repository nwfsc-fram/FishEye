        <h1>Number of vessels or number of processors</h1>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The number of participants is reported to both monitor for changes in participation and to provide context for other metrics (PFMC and NMFS, 2017, 3.1.1(b)(1)). 
            Filters are also provided to show how the number of participants varies by fishery, operation size, and location.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The number of vessels participating in the catch share program is obtained from state fish tickets for the shorebased sector and from the NORPAC database for 
            the at-sea sectors. The number of processors participating in the catch share program is obtained from state fish tickets and EDC data. There is no record of 
            processing operations outside of EDC data; therefore, whether or not a company processes fish is determined using fish production information provided by companies 
            on their EDC submission.
        </p>
        <p><b>Method:</b>
            The total number of participants is reported for all sectors. The number of vessels is reported for the catcher vessel, mothership and catcher-processor sectors and 
            the number of companies is reported for shorebased processors.  A vessel is counted as a participant if they made at least one delivery within the fishery being 
            reported. See Fishery and Production Activity Designations Section for a description of how fisheries are defined and how vessels are designated to a fishery. 
            A processor is counted as a participant of the catch share program for a given survey year if 1) state fish tickets indicate they received greater than two catch 
            share deliveries, and 2) EDC data indicate processing of groundfish or whiting. Processing of groundfish or whiting is determined by whether EDC data indicates 
            processed product types (i.e., listed as product type other than Unprocessed) and communication with the participant does not indicate otherwise.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Some operations may own multiple vessels. Analyzing the performance of sets of operations is outside of the scope of the current analysis. For processors, the unit of 
            analysis is the first receiver site license owner (or company), which takes into account how businesses self-identify their operations. This unit of analysis is used to 
            maintain analytical consistency, reduce the reporting burden for participants, and protect confidential data.  Some license owners have multiple buying and processing 
            locations and data are aggregated across locations. There are also some cases where individual license owners are known to be linked by common ownership; however, data 
            are not aggregated beyond the license owner level.

        <h1>Vessel attributes</h1>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>Vessel length, vessel fuel capacity, and vessel horsepower</p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The following suite of metrics capture characteristics of a vessel that contribute to operational capacity. Changes in fuel capacity, horsepower, and length may indicate 
            technological advances to improve vessel efficiency or ability to catch fish.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:></b>
            EDC forms request vessels to report the length, fuel capacity, and horsepower of the vessel for catcher vessels, motherships, and catcher-processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Method:</b>
            The following metrics are used as-reported in the forms, and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median). Total is only reported for vessel fuel capacity.
            <li>Vessel length (feet)</li>
            <li>Vessel fuel capacity (gallons)</li>
            <li>Vessel horsepower</li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Changes in these metrics can be the result of physical changes made to vessels or changes in the composition of vessels participating.
        </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Vessel market value and vessel replacement value</h1>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Vessel market and replacement value provide information about a companyâ€™s physical assets. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request the market and replacement value of the vessel related to the most recent marine survey.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are used as-reported in the forms, and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median); total values are not reported.
            <li>Vessel market value</li>
            <li>Vessel replacement value</li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            A small number of vessels include the value of permits, quota, and fishing gear in the market and replacement value. Increases in market value 
            can indicate that existing vessels have invested in improvements to their vessel and/or newer more valuable vessels have entered the fishery. 
            Differences in replacement value and market value may indicate that vessels in the fleet are aging and improvements are not keeping pace with depreciation.
        </p>
        <p>For processors, the EDC form requests information on market value and replacement value of facilities based on the most recent appraisal. However, we do not 
            report these values as very few processors provide non-NA responses, which may in part be due to lease arrangements between the processing company and the owners of 
            the facilities where they are located.
