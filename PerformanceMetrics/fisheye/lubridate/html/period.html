<h2>Create a period object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>period</code> creates a period object with the specified values. period
provides the behaviour of <code><a href="period.html">period</a></code> in a way that is more
suitable for automating within a function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
period(num = NULL, units = "second", ...)

is.period(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector that lists the number of time units to be
included in the period. From v1.6.0 <code>num</code> can also be a character
vector that specifies durations in a convenient shorthand format. All
unambiguous name units and abbreviations are supported. One letter &quot;m&quot;
stands for months, &quot;M&quot; stands for minutes. See examples.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector that lists the type of units to be used. The
units in units are matched to the values in num according to their
order. When <code>num</code> is character, this argument is ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of time units to be included in the period and their
amounts. Seconds, minutes,  hours, days, weeks, months, and years are
supported. Normally only one of <code>num</code> or <code>...</code> are present. If
both are present, the periods are concatenated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an R object</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Within a Period object, time units do not have a fixed length (except for
seconds) until they are added to a date-time. The length of each time unit
will depend on the date-time to which it is added. For example, a year that
begins on 2009-01-01 will be 365 days long.  A year that begins on 2012-01-01
will be 366 days long. When math is performed with a period object, each unit
is applied separately. How the length of a period is distributed among its
units is non-trivial. For example, when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer
than 60 seconds.
</p>
<p>Periods track the change in the &quot;clock time&quot; between two date-times. They
are measured in common time related units: years, months, days, hours,
minutes, and seconds. Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in
integer values.
</p>
<p>Period objects can be easily created with the helper functions
<code><a href="quick_periods.html">years</a></code>, <code><a href="../../base/html/weekday.POSIXt.html">months</a></code>, <code><a href="quick_periods.html">weeks</a></code>,
<code><a href="quick_periods.html">days</a></code>, <code><a href="quick_periods.html">hours</a></code>, <code><a href="quick_periods.html">minutes</a></code>,
and <code><a href="quick_periods.html">seconds</a></code>. These objects can be added to and subtracted
to date-times to create a user interface similar to object oriented programming.
</p>
<p>Note: Arithmetic with periods can results in undefined behavior when
non-existent dates are involved (such as February 29th). Please see
<code><a href="Period-class.html">Period-class</a></code> for more details and <code><a href="mplus.html">%m+%</a></code> and
<code><a href="mplus.html">add_with_rollback</a></code> for alternative operations.

period("2M 1sec")
period("2hours 2minutes 1second")
period("2d 2H 2M 2S")
period("2days 2hours 2mins 2secs")
# Missing numerals default to 1. Repeated units are added up.
duration("day day")
# Comparison with characters is supported from v1.6.0.
duration("day 2 sec") &gt; "day 1sec"
is.period(as.Date("2009-08-03")) # FALSE
is.period(period(months= 1, days = 15)) # TRUE
